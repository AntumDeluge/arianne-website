      <![CDATA[Have you noticed the graceful round tower in Semos Mountains and wondered what goes on in that lofty spire? The guardian of the tower, Zekiel, has prepared a quest for you - complete the Wizards Circle and access will be granted. 
<p>
Perhaps the sorceress Sarzina visited the Wizards Circle, for she has a new power also; she can enable you to visualise your karma: good, or bad, at any time. 
<p>
The magic from that round tower is overspilling into the world, and your imagination. What was square has become circular - when you visualise attacks, you'll now see circles. Your hearing may be more advanced, with strains of music, bells, and other sounds now audible that you could not hear before. 
<p>
You'll find heightened awareness of the world around you, for example pathways will be more clearly marked and you can more readily access your inventory, or any help you need. If you keep your eyes and ears open, you'll discover many more magical little <a href="/game/stendhal.html#changes">changes</a> in the world.

      <![CDATA[Farmers like Karl have learnt a more efficient sowing technique. Each small patch of grain in the fields is planted closer together, so it will slow you down when you walk over that patch, but you can walk more easily between grain rows than before. After you harvested all your grain, you'd take it to Jenny to be milled. Do you sometimes forget that you left an order with her, or for how much? Well, now you can use /listproducers to be reminded of all your orders you placed with Jenny and other workers who cast, make and bake for you. You may use that to remember to collect some sandwiches you made with Leander, for Phalk. The dwarf guardian is hungry at his station in Semos mines and would appreciate some food and drink.
<p>
Stendhal 0.85 has some changes you'll notice as you start the client, too. There is a new wooden panel theme and now it is used for all the parts of the Stendhal client including the buttons on the first screen. When you login to your account you'll notice a dialog with your character, you need to click on that to login. If you have more than one account, you can merge them, so that when you login you can choose between your characters. Please read <a href = "http://stendhalgame.org/wiki/Stendhal_Account_Merging">http://stendhalgame.org/wiki/Stendhal_Account_Merging</a> for more details. This is optional, it does not affect gameplay, and you can still play more than one character at the same time. ]]>

      <![CDATA[       Are you an obsessive hoarder of rare items? Do you pay high sums for a durin axe (just because it is rare) or camp hours to win a nihonto? Balduin is just like you. If, and only if, you've completed every other quest to collect special items, he'll challenge you to find one more... but don't bother asking your friends what he challenged them with, your quest could well be different.
  <p>
      Despot Halb Errvl has been sitting alone in the Mithrilbourgh Throne Room for too long. He's become really paranoid about rival armies, and is asking for help killing hundreds of enemies. He doesn't care where you find them, so long as you kill as many as possible. Others who ask for your help in for example cleaning a cellar of spiders, really will check now that you killed spiders from their cellar and not just any old spider. They realised that we've been deceiving them a little in the past with our proof of kills!
<p>      The pizza baker Leander is now more responsible: he sends his employees only to locations that he is confident they can survive in. But the food situation at Ados Wild Life Refuge has got worse: they are now in need of weekly supplies. Katinka will ask you to bring food they need for the animals in the zoo, and to thank you Dr. Feelgood will heal your pets and sheep and might sell you some cheap medicine. If you are not interested in feeding the animals to get cheap potions you can still buy them elsewhere. There is Carmen in Semos, and in Fado is Sarzina, who joined the potion market, selling mega potions.
 <p>
      Last but not least the user interface was improved so that status icons for being away or eating are also displayed in the side panel. Flying arrows are now visible in the world, and if you'd like supplies of these to experiment with you can buy them from Mrotho and Diehelm Brui. Missiles are effective too, and early experimentation has shown that fire shuriken work somewhat better than snowballs... ]]>

    <title>Stendhal 0.83: Dark or Light, Fire or Ice?</title>

      <![CDATA[The forces of the elements have lain dormant in the world for a long time. 
But now, fire, ice, dark and light magic is awakening. Those wielding a fire sword will find excellent results
 when fighting for example an ice elemental, while fire elementals resist fire weapons very well. Likewise, magical defensive items can aid, or can hinder, when fighting magical creatures. A black shield gives extra protection against the dark power of a black death, but is vulnerable to the light magic emanating from an angel.
<p>
Military leaders started to question their attack strategies recently, wondering why their troops are never changing target
to kill off the weakest enemy first. So, the top military leaders (commanders, generals, and so on) are trialling a system of targetting the weakest enemy first, and even changing attack if a new, weaker enemy is within reach. Sources suggest that this tactic was actually inspired by the dragons and elite creatures, who themselves thought of the idea first. In any case, it is true that dragons and the strongest creatures have also adopted this 'attack the weakest' policy.
<p>
The Ados Mayor has been grateful for help with his 'rat problem' - but the situation is getting worse, with more rats 
invading the city whenever one spots an opportunity. To help Ados just listen out for Mayor Chalmers: he'll surely call when he needs help. He's also sent warriors to investigate the so-called 'Rat City' deep in Or'ril dungeons, who have noticed increased activity there recently, a larger population of the talking rat men and women, and some open doors to reach new dungeons.
<p>
As you explore it's good to know what you're looking at and how you can interact with the world. Now your mouse cursor gives you a hint: for enemies it displays a sword representing combat, for other people, or signs to look at, a magnifying glass is shown, for the ground you can walk on, some footprints, and so on. For those already with /clickmode set for single click walking, these actions shown by the mouse are done with a single click, too. This includes attack, look, inspect or loot a corpse, use a portal (even from a distance). There is no change for those with double click /clickmode. Using items from the bag will remain double click for everyone (since you may single click on items to drag and drop them).
<p>
There's much more news than can fit here, so to read about the many other changes please check <a href="/game/stendhal.html#changes">the Stendhal changelog.</a>

      <![CDATA[Is that a giant soap bubble which has landed in Kalavan City? No, it's a magical orb, and provided that Ilisa has taught you the art of scrying, you can use this magical orb to take you ... erm ... who knows! Somewhere fun, that's for sure. While you're in the Kalavan area, if you can brave the castle, you'll find someone with a favour to ask you.
<p>If you get around using automatic walking, you should notice smoother movement, and that you can start walking with only one click, not two. 
Hopefully you've been enjoying the rich variety of sounds and music around recently. Now you have ability to set the overall sound volume, and even adjust creature volume independently of the background music volume, for example.  
<p>Rats are particularly noisy little critters, and Ados is starting to have a bit of a rat problem. When you hear the Ados mayor shout for help, would you please go kill some rats in buildings inside Ados? The city is getting overrun and he'll reward you well.
<p>Spring is well on the way, so if you are lucky you can find the Easter Bunny hopping about, and he might have a present for you. And we'd love it if you can join us for a <a href="http://stendhalgame.org/news/-45.html">Spring festival party</a> this weekend.]]>

Did you know that one of your friends from Semos is a composer of music? <a 
href="http://stendhalgame.org/character/storyteller.html">Storyteller</a> wrote some songs and they're playing now in various places. <a 
href="http://stendhalgame.org/character/plassy.html">Plassy</a> created the system to play the music and <a 
href="http://stendhalgame.org/character/hendrik.html">hendrik</a> showed Margaret 
in 
the tavern and the spirits in the dungeons how to play it. 
<p>
The telepath Io Flotto has strengthened the /ignore instruction for you. Now, when you are ignoring chat from another, they look shaded out to black. It means you won't see the outfit and the name becomes less readable. In the demonstration image here you can see Athor labyrinth, which <a href="http://stendhalgame.org/character/laguz.html">Laguz</a> has redecorated.
<p>
Did you sometimes have problems with holes in your bag when you moved items around in it? Well, Ida the seamstress has very kindly sewed them all up for you. We think that <a href="http://stendhalgame.org/character/kiheru.html">kiheru</a> taught her a new technique, and now you should accidentally drop items less. 
<p>
Finally for those of you who love playing so much that you would like your own server to play on, the installation process has been <a

simplified</a>. Remember, Stendhal is software released under an open source license, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>!

    <title>Event: Hunt for the lost cat!</title>
    <date>24th January 2010</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[
On Friday 22nd January a sign appeared in Semos:
<br><i>"I hid my cat somewhere in Fauimoni. Find and bring her to semos tavern 
and totaling up to 48,500 HP and a few scrolls. You 
have until Sunday 11:59.59 server time. Good luck and thanks 
for your participation. Note, cats name has been changed. 
lol Have fun!"</i>
<br>Geomac had created this hide and seek game for the players! So the hunt 
started, from all those who were worried about the cat left alone, 
and those who wanted the generous prize.
But where was the cat? By Saturday it was still not found and geomac 
added this message:
<br><i>"Clue: An Item needed by Linzo is nearby."</i>
<br>Finally on Sunday morning snakevip found geomac's cat, deenie, on the 
3rd floor of Ados Townhall, by Reg Denson. Snakevip brought deenie to 
Semos tavern and was rewarded with ingredients for 
100 pizzas, 100 fish pies, 24 gold bars, 2 home scrolls, 1 empty scroll, 
and a marked scroll to Wofol bakery where he could make the pizzas! A 
wonderful reward and a really great event, many thanks to geomac for 
organising this.

      <![CDATA[
Budding salesmen, there is help at hand for make your trading smooth! Harold will be your middle-man, you tell him what price you want to sell your item for, and he will take it from you. Anyone who comes to ask him what offers he has recorded has the chance to buy your item. Once your item is sold, Harold will give you the price that you asked for it. He's new to the job, so he's only accepting 3 offers per person, so that he doesn't overload himself with work. 
<p>If you prefer to deal direct with tradesmen, barmaids, and suppliers, then you'll find that easier now too. A kind artist has painted each shop blackboard (or book) with a picture, price, and description of each item for sale. Just look closely at the sign by each shop, and you will see something like the picture on the right here. 
<p>Do you remember Haizen, the wizard who sells scrolls? He's learnt some new tricks recently. If you ask him, he'll create a fiendishly difficult maze for you. Can you be the fastest maze runner? You can try a new maze once a day. If that isn't enough to keep you occupied, some of the female population of the island need your help; Carmen, Jenny and Mrs. Yeti would all be happy to hear from you.
<p>We're really happy with the community here, and we hope you are too. But sometimes there's someone you really just want to ignore, and not hear anything at all from. Well, now <i>/ignore name</i> will mean you can't see private or public messages from that person, until you choose to <i>/unignore name</i>. To check who you are currently ignoring, you can type <i>/ignore</i>. Have fun!]]>

      <![CDATA[Marauroa is Arianne's Multiplayer Online Engine Server, which you can use to build your own online games.
Marauroa 3.3 introduces new features: RPEvents can have RPSlots. This means that events sent from the server to the

                doesTableExist and doesColumnExist in order to update it.
<p>There are also some bug fixes, to make Marauroa more stable, for example in the case of database errors. Full details can

<p>Harold explained to his saviours what had happened, how he had been kidnapped, and he thanked them for saving him. He also told them that the whole experience had made him realise that his job was much too dangerous, and now he is going to look for a different job. Lets wish him luck in this!]]>

    <title>Raid: New Year Revolt</title>
    <date>1st January 2010</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[
Semos was in danger this New Year, from creatures which threatened to invade. 
Legions of creatures started to appear in the Semos Mine Towns, and a cast of blackness fell over the island.
Mayor Sakhs had been forewarned of the disaster, and he called warriors to help defend Semos. 
He also begged them to find a number of ancient relics which may help protect against the evil.
      <div align="center"><img src="screens/stendhal/raid010110.png" alt="New Year Revolt" width="100%" height="100%"/></div>
<p>It was not easy for the brave warriors, they had to seek out the creatures, which were smart and tried to attack from many places.
Although the revolt started in the Mine Town, it spread across the mountain ridges, through the plains, 
and then south west around Semos Jail. Many of the creatures had enhanced strength and health, and the warriors worked as teams
to destroy each and every one. Once all the creatures were killed and all ankhs had been found, the warriors journeyed back to the 
townhall and presented the ankhs for the safety of Semos. 
<p>Those intrepid warriors who found ankhs were: shadon, jesco, giovanote (2), kezman, kiyosh, moritzger and madmetzger.
      <div align="center"><img src="screens/stendhal/townhall010110.png" alt="Townhall" width="100%" height="100%"/></div>
<p>Thanks to all who help to defend Semos, whether from the New Year Revolt or the day by day threats. Happy New Year!]]>

captured on her way back from the Semos Mine Town revival party. She was missing for two years and there was no 
party during that time - all of Ados searched for her. Last year, she was found aboard a pirate ship by players who had been defending Ados from a 
pirate attack. Mein_Dino, IschBing, Maja and Peka were heroes at that raid! This year there will be no fighting or danger, just lots of fun.

Also, the chat log is no longer a separate floating window, but a resizeable panel attached to the screen. It's a major step forward and something players have wanted for a long time, soon we hope to be able to move the Bag and Character panels out of the world screen too. It gives you plenty more space to see ...
<p>
... terrifying creatures. Do you love to fight these? Then go to the magic city and find the Challenger Haastaja and his pet chaos green dragonrider inside his house. He will summon an adventure island for you, with creatures chosen just for you to kill. (And chosen to be a challenge ... ) It's expensive, and you can only go to the adventure island once every 3 days, but it is well worth the money and the wait. 
<p>
If you started the adventure called marriage, you'll notice a change in wedding rings. Ognir used magical gold which has limited power, and this power which provides the teleport works best between equals. Once you have used the ring you need to wait at least 5 minutes for it to recharge itself. If you used it to be with a spouse who is a very different level to you, the wait is longer. If you had not been lucky enough to find someone else who would marry you, and you resorted to marrying yourself (a clone), you might find this really affects you, if your clone is very low in level. So, if you want to divorce them instead of levelling them up, then you can temporarily take advantage of Wilfred's special offer. He is letting you pay a fee instead of taking a 3% xp loss on divorce. The fee is 200 x your level, and if you have the money he'll automatically offer you it - if you don't, he'll automatically offer the xp loss.

      <![CDATA[Everything has changed but nothing is different. So, what's happened? The engine Marauroa which runs Stendhal and controls the database has had major refactoring; mainly to how it accesses the databases. Things are now possible which weren't before, but these all go on 'behind the scenes'. So, in the world of Stendhal, our NPCs, players, creatures, fighting, banks, items, farming, houses, zones and quests, are all unchanged. Stendhal has been ported to use the newly rewritten engine but everything should look exactly as before.*
<p>
We're really happy to announce that the Stendhal client is now <b>compatible with OpenJDK</b>! This is great as OpenJDK is the default Java with many Linux distributions now, so we are happy to have this compatibility. Thanks to omair who provided the fix. 
<p>
* Well, not quite everything, as corpses have now been redrawn and new types added. It's also now possible to specify a specific corpse for each creature (instead of one across each class) so if you think a certain creature or creature class should have a different looking corpse, and can draw one, please send us your best efforts!

    <title>Marauroa 3.0: multithreading and extended database support</title>
    <date>2 August 2009 23:16:00</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[With Marauroa 3.0, the game engine now supports multithreading, and it is possible to run parallel transactions in different threads. JDBCDatabase has been split into several small *DAO (Data Access Object) classes. Low level database operations are now in the new package marauroa.server.db. These changes will require you to port any application using Marauroa, so for help on how to port your application see <a href="http://stendhalgame.org/wiki/index.php/Refactoring_Database_Access_in_Marauroa">Refactoring Database Access in Marauroa</a>. Additionally, we have begun work on supporting other database systems beside MySQL.

      <![CDATA[It's all about beauty at this time of year. You'll see it if you buy daisies seeds or lilia seeds from Jenny and watch them grow into fabulous flowers. Be sure you plant them on the patch of fertile ground in Semos Plains North. Anyone can pick your fully grown flower, so you're doing a public service by planting them for all to watch and for some lucky person to pick. Perhaps they're most beautiful left in the ground, though. 
<p>
You'll see it too in the improved looks of many items and creatures, not to mention the amazing new stendhal splashscreen as voted by YOU the players! If you enjoyed that competition, keep looking out for the next one, you can take part by entering or voting, or both.  
<p>
Do you ever see players who should not yet have mastered the black arts, but somehow have many black items? Explicitly: low level players who are stacked with really good stuff? Well, although they can use them still, they will get less good defense from defensive items, and attacking weapons will hit with a lower rate, if the user is less than the minimum level required for the item. The closer you are to the minimum level the better you can use the item, and of course if you have more than the min level required to use it properly, you get the optimal stats from it. So, if your player has a 'twin' who you have gifted items to, you may find that his level is not high enough to use them effectively. Or if you're a genuine player but have been lucky enough to receive a lot of very high level gifts, you may prefer to wait to use those gifts till you are at the correct level for them. What apprentice can truly wield his master's sword?]]>

      <![CDATA[Player houses have just got even better! Each house comes with a storage chest, it's not like a player chest where each player sees 
their own items - it's like the Semos community chest, but inside the house! Everyone with a key can access it, so if you're worried and can't 
remember who you gave a key to, or if you die and lose your key, hurry to your house seller and ask to get your locks changed. When you're stood 
outside a house door you can see who owns the house, or if it's for sale, and you can also knock so that anyone inside the house knows you are there. 
Of course all these features do come with a little teeny cost, and that is a regular House Tax, of 1000 money charged once per month. If you do not 
go and pay the Ados Taxman then interest is charged, so you owe more, and if you omit to pay for 6 months then you lose your house completely! (This 
is in fact good news for players, because it means the houses bought by people who no longer play will become free again, yay!) If the tax is too 
worrying for you, you can simply resell your house to the state, and regain some of the money you spent on buying it.

<p>
The people who live on Fauimoni have started to notice the bad aura around those who kill other players, and now they refuse to buy any items from 
player killers. They will still sell items to player killers, but they charge a bit more. There's plenty more to tell about: creatures, messages, 
more magic outfits, these we leave to you to explore! ]]>

      <![CDATA[The Semos Mine Town Revival Weeks Party is over and Susi and her daddy are safe at home now in Ados City. Liliana the magic costume maker has opened a boutique in the magic city, her outfits now last for longer but cost a little more to buy. A new outfit is a great way to express yourself so it is well worth it! Another new way to express yourself is by using the /me command. Just try typing for example '/me loves Stendhal' or '/me thinks kymara is awesome' and you will get the idea!
<p>

Do you enter the Ados Deathmatch often? Next time before you go in, try asking Thonatus which heroes are already battling inside. You'd be surprised how accurately he remembers who has recently taken the challenge. Just in case you have trouble finding him, you should know that he has become tired of dodging the dangerous fallen high priests and walking amongst the smelly fallen warriors. He now sticks to the upper (northern) parts of the swamp, it is safer there. 
<p>

For those players who prefer even safer areas such as Semos city, you must have noticed how crowded the bank can be. This is great for when you want to chat or trade but sometimes one yearns for privacy. Now you can ask Dagobert for access to a personal vault. It's there only when you ask for it, and when you leave it vanishes, so any items which you accidentally leave on the ground are returned to you. You can use a magic scroll to exit the vault, or a portal, and also the ability to use scrolls to exit Semos Bank itself has been restored.
<p>

So, players have learnt a number of new abilities - what about creatures? Not to be left out, they have been in training with weapons and learned how to use weapons to attack either slow or fast. Some creatures like the balrog now hit very slow but harder for each hit. Other creatures like a nimble archmage elf or infantry gnome make only very weak hits but faster than normal. It will make for an exciting time so don't delay, try out the new features today.

For a short time only, visit the Semos Mine Town and get an exciting magic outfit, try a puzzle or chat with the centre of the party, Susi. 
<p>
Another piece of very good news is about Thanatos, the Death match Assistant. Any of you who have done a Deathmatch will know that Thanatos has suffered from hallucinations for a long time - he sometimes saw live creatures, even when there were none, and wouldn't let you claim your Deathmatch victory! The best doctors in the land have treated him and we're happy to say he's shown a huge improvement in his ability to do his job. He's also had a chat with Mayor Sakhs of Semos, and explained to him that if a player has helped another kill a creature in Deathmatch, even if they didn't start it, then the Mayor should really reward the helper duly. Have fun!]]>

      <![CDATA[
<p>Warriors, take note! For the rules of combat have changed, and to be ignorant of them is to be in mortal danger!!
<p>The Revised Battle Creed, applying to all beings, creature and human:
<ul>
<li>Experience level <i>and</i> attack skill both influence the fighter's ability to damage
<li>Experience level <i>and</i> defense skill both influence the fighter's ability to defend
<li>Even weak beings <i>can</i> harm the strongest being
<li>Against fearsome creatures a heavy weapon is mightier than a knife or dagger
<li>Be wary when patrolling in hostile areas. Enemies may appear at any moment
</ul>...for only human warriors:
<ul>
<li>A warrior shall not attack another human soul if he is much weaker than himself, except in defence
<li>All shall know when they are safe from attack by any other warrior, by the green aura of protection
<li>Those who kill another soul shall be branded with the red skull of death
</ul>
<p>Be very aware, the principles of damage apply equally to creatures. You experienced warriors will notice much faster, harder battles than you are used to. Therefore, be cautious until you are again confident of your abilities, and then, go forth and fight!]]>

<p>The threats of Blordrough's dark legion forces cooperation between citizens. Believe it or not, scientists and magicians set aside their beliefs and differences. 
They combine efforts to make an awesome piece of equipment that can be used to <i>your</i> advantage. Hmmm, or perhaps they are just doing it for the love of Ida. It is a mission for which you will need to ask for help from many types of people, and you will have plenty you need to collect on the way.

<p>You'll probably be too busy to take a balloon ride up to Kikareukin clouds, and you might even struggle to find time for raids in Fado's new battle arena. If you're even too distracted to look after your pet properly, it will be well looked after in Ados pet sanctuary. Just ask Katinka for help and she will take care of it for you, permanently.
<br>You should make sure you look after yourself well when working so hard, eat regularly ... but not <i>too</i> regularly, because if you stuff too much food into your mouth at once you can choke. Choking hurts ... and can even kill you, so greedy people better watch out!

<p>Finally the generous among you will notice that their good karma is lasting longer - you don't need good luck to defeat something significantly weaker than you, just skill. So your luck is saved up for when you really need it. Like in Kikareukin clouds ...]]>

      <![CDATA[There's always work to do in Faiumoni. Recently we've been fixing leaks, patching up holes and oiling rusty mechanisms. With all these problems solved, you'll notice less bugs scuttling around. Another change you'll notice is that the number in brackets on your character panel after the ATK and DEF levels now shows the skills needed to level up to the next level. It will count down as you fight instead of counting up.

<p>Linda from Fado Hotel has been on a training course. She now sends couples together to their honeymoon, first checking they are 'just married', of course. She explains about the invitation scroll a bit better now, and is so clever she doesn't even let you go if you don't have space in your bag for the scroll!

<p>Aenihata got bored one day while protecting Semos from the balrog deep in the mines. So he practised some of his 'terraforming' spells and made a brand new cave! Luckily he still has plenty of magic power to keep the barrier around the balrog up.

<p>Finally we must congratulate Stendhal's artists, who have done a brilliant job over the last year. We had some artworks which we found ugly, or just outdated. So we have been painting our own, and sourcing some from other free projects like Stendhal. You probably noticed the grass getting texture, houses being rebuilt and flowerbeds being replanted for the last few releases. Well, we've finally finished redrawing the old art work and are really happy with the outcome.]]>

<p>
Perhaps your loved one likes cute cuddly animals? Then take a stroll around the farm east of Semos. It's full of cute piglets, goats, cows and little tiny mice.

Alone for Valentines? Go kill some dwarves! That'll help! The orcs in ados abandoned keep want to be rid of the mountain dwarves, so you'd even be doing them a favour.

Also that admin can jail players who are offline, and they can be freed even if the server is restarted inbetween.

The extra cold winter has brought out the ice and air elementals, and they've taught the fire, water and earth elementals to toughen up as they have always been a little weak. How about you, do you wish to learn new secrets? Perhaps the secret of how to get past the lich and his lair? You will need a new skill for that, and the cunning to discover it yourself.
<p>
The world continues to expand, and get easier to travel across. There are now routes between the newer cities of Kalavan and Kirdneh, using the underground great caves as a shortcut past Fado forest. If you do explore above ground, look out for the forest nymphs - they don't get many visitors. In Kirdneh, you'll notice house numbers on all the doors. They're not ready for ownership yet but feel free to look around the city and chat to the locals.

great caves were discovered, full of cave trolls, madarams, and dragons. Huge
creatures like dragons seem even bigger now that you can walk behind them.
But nothing is so huge as the Imperial Army, with the huge Kalavan Castle and the
huge underground city of Sedah. 

<p>There's something 'strange' been happening, too, like the strange rainbow
beans to take you to a strange dream world. There is a strange magic city full
of wizards and witches, healers and sorcerers. And there is the strange fact that suddenly, 
your ability to defend yourself, depends also on your experience of the world.

<p>There's something 'sweet' developing: sweet little cats you can care for,
and sweet homes in Kalavan City, which you can buy to live in. Sweet too are
the princesses who give you quests, and there are sweet treats: pineapples, coconuts and fairy cakes.

<p>There's something 'wild' out there: wild women on the Amazon Island; wild creatures whose habits 
are now a lot less predictable; and wildly animated tiles.

<p>Finally, there's something safe in knowing that your bank chest is more
secure. There's safety too in the knowledge that if you're unhappily married,
you can now divorce. And if you want to stay safe, you can get information
about any creature you like, from the famed warrior Starkad. Perhaps one day
you will have fought as much as him ...]]>

Prison breakout! Duergars swarmed the prison below the dwarven kingdom of Kanmararn. Will you join the dwarves or leave them to their fate?

<p>Explorers coming from the west are talking about new places they have found. They say that if you get past the Devil Queen, you will find yourself in a place called Kikareukin which is floating in the sky! But be careful as Kikareukin
is not just a walk in the clouds...

<p>If you have some spare axes, Woody the Woodcutter living east of Fado might want to buy them. While over there you may bump into leprechauns and clurichauns, though they'll try to protect their lucky charms. The final piece of advice before you enter again to Faiumoni: beware, only the very strong should enter Oni castle battle the strange purple creatures!]]>

    <title>Is your client is slow AND you use Linux/X11?</title>
    <date>29 Jun 2007 23:32:02</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[
You can try this for a quick fix.<p>
Download stendhal client and start it with the following command line:
<pre>java -Dsun.java2d.pmoffscreen=false -Xmx200m -jar stendhal-XX.jar</pre>
or with:
<pre>java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true -Xmx200m -jar stendhal-XX.jar</pre>
(XX is whichever stendhal you run with, maybe 0.58 or 0.61 ..)
<p>
We are sorry for the inconvenience. <br> This problem is caused by a glitch in X11 pixmap and alpha usage in combination with java runtime.
We are working on a solution and will inform you when the issue is solved and this work around is not needed anymore.      ]]>

The houses in Kobold City (known to the Kobolds as Wofol) have opened their doors. Meet Wrvil the weapons trader, and a mountain dwarf who needs errands running. You had better hope noone asks you for anything which requires going to the swamps outside Ados - the creatures there have mutated into things much nastier. The resident ghost over in Ados haunted house is just the opposite - very friendly and she wants to know about other spirits like her. Just make sure you don't get caught in giant webs in the basement ... <p>
Elsewhere in Ados, the barracks buy some of the very best equipment around, and pay good prices. There must be a general shortage of armor, because the Quartermaster of Mithrilbourgh army also requires boots and helmets. Or if you find mainly cloaks in your travels, don't waste them, take them to a seamstress who uses them to make sails for ships. <p>
Talking of ships, if you're on the Athor ferry, remember to fish for mackerel. You need that to make tasty fish pies! Find out the other ingredients from Linzo in Fado. And if you're a fan of fishing, why not try wishing? Look for wells with a sparkle to them, and make a wish. Good luck!]]>

Today, it has been a long day.
<p>
Ados, Semos and Nalwor have been under attack, but our brave warriors have saved them again.
<p>
Julius shouted and ran away when barbarians came to attack Ados. Lucky that eusebius and others were around. Eusebius got an enhanced Ugmash from the mayor of Ados as a reward for his help in saving Ados.
<p>
Mareion asked us for help when the drows started attacking Nalwor. Evil drows even summoned a cursed giant spider.
Many heroes came to defeat them, and again Vesper won, but kindly passed the award to Juan_1990_16 who received a black_halberd.
<p>
Just after that, goblins started to attack Semos, but they were not alone. They came with the giant Tobuk, a friend of the goblins, but again, a horde of Semos citizens came and defeated them.
<p>
You can be our next hero! :)]]>

      <![CDATA[
Semos mines have been excavated deeper, producing new rocks and stones which were used to rebuild many tired looking buildings. All the citizens think it looks much better and even redecorated indoors as a result. However, digging the mines has opened up new passages and caverns ... they are no longer just the home of cute and cuddly kobolds, as here dwell the Chaos warriors! Also swarming the mines is a whole outpost of the Mithrilborough army, not to mention the mountain dwarves and a much, much, much greater beast. The mountain dwarves are famed blacksmiths - so all the creatures and monsters in Fauimoni traded in the things they fight with - clubs, armor and shields - for better versions. You may find that a monster drops something better than you expected - but he will not want to drop it often.<p>
The bridge to Fado is open! Discover the delights of the city known across the land as the home of celebrations - of good food and marriage. Find a pretty maiden with a quest for you, and learn about karma from a wizardess. Over in Nalwor, it is less peaceful. The dark elves are still making trouble, and the mayor needs your help. Do what he asks and a special protective prize will be yours. You can fear less from death - but remember, there are now many more who wish to take life from you.]]>

Ados has expanded! The city dwellers are getting desperate for supplies, so the mayor begs your help. As you return, beware of getting drawn into the great caves under Ados Rock. The brave who venture there talk of giants, red dragons and black death. You'll need to face the giants if you want to earn the immortal sword, and anyone who can defeat the black death may loot some rare shadow armament. If the ados caves don't scare you enough, try the drow tunnels. Are the dark elves planning an attack on Nalwor?<p>
If you want to get away from it all, take a break on Athor Island. It's got it all: sun, sea, sand, oh and cannibals, crocodiles and minotaurs ... Both hard workers and holiday makers can help out Leander. He needs pizza delivered across Faiumoni. Get it there on time and you'll get a tidy tip. Perhaps you'll choose to store your cash in Nalwor bank - once you've earned the key, that is. Are you fed up of all those keys jangling in your bag? Then get your keyring fixed, a blacksmith should be able to help.<p>
Thanks to some dedicated cleaning, the waters of Faiumoni are now fresh and full of life. Fish have come back to the surface, and if you look carefully you may see glints of gold. Even the air has had a spring clean, so that sounds travel to your ear fresher, and clearer. Enjoy! And fight bravely ...

      <![CDATA[
There was great joy recently in Semos Town Square when Carmen got a bit confused and started selling large amounts of potions for negative amounts of money. All sellers have been given new instructions and bigger abacuses to calculate on. 
<p>
Any adventurers who profited from the confusion have returned their extra items, as they are all honest players. (No players were harmed in the enforcement of this rule...)
<p>
High level players have had a boost recently. With the level cap of 99 removed, players over this found that they earned only 1 XP for even Black Dragons! Now, instead of earning 1 XP, or full XP for every creature (a short term fix) they now earn full XP only for creatures over level 75. A fair solution! ]]>

The elves are back to their homes and businesses in Nalwor City, and they're pretty mad that humans have been visiting! Tread carefully next time you make a trip. Maybe you'll be tempted to travel far, now that walking long distance is enabled by double clicking your minimap. Perhaps you'll visit the Rat City? A careless ratman has left a door open...<p>
For those who just want a quiet life, they'll find that ctrl+r clears all those annoying chat bubbles. That's not recommended in the middle of a trade on the new trading table in Semos Town Hall. You want to have your wits about you for bargaining the best prices. While you're in the Town Hall - go chat to the Mayor, as he now tells you exactly how long to wait till your next daily monster quest. He might ask you to kill some of the troublesome bandits on the road from Semos to Ados?<p>
More than trouble lurks beneath the graveyard in Semos Plains North ... vampires roam the Catacombs. If you want to hear the stories, go to the ancient dwarf blacksmith in the mines of Or'ril mountain. And if you're brave enough, begin the quest for the Vampire Sword.       ]]>

      <![CDATA[The Mayor of Semos made a tour of Faumoni recently to discuss administrative issues. He has deemed that any rewards bestowed upon an adventurer should be used only by he who earned them. In the Mayor's tour he noticed some irregularities in the terrain: gardeners and architects have been employed to fix these. He also taught better use of language to many of his citizens.<p>
Thanatos got approval for some changes to the deathmatch. He thinks it should only reward the player who starts it. He complained of cowards who disappear mid match, without the proper procedure of begging 'bail' from him. These might experience problems in future. Frequent visitors to the arena may have noticed the improved intelligence of black dragons and been relieved they don't fight them themselves. Well, the dragons have taught their secrets to every creature on the island, even the smallest and slowest, so now everything is a lot smarter.<p>
Mayor Sakhs' visit didn't cover every spot on the island. He'd heard reports of a heathen outdoor temple on the mountain pass between Orril and Semos, but he claims religion is not his business. Perhaps he was afraid of powerful demons there? He also didn't venture past the 'Keep Out' sign in Ados after hearing strange wails and bangs inside. The children in Ados park also keep away from that house, although they did complain of boredom. Maybe they'd like something to play with ... Someone else who is keen for new 'toys' is Balduin. He's been told about new kinds of monster and he wants to add their weapons to his collection.  ]]>

Everyone is invited to come meet the population of Ados. With the knowledge from these new people, Zynn Iwuhos the librarian has been hard at work. He's made detailed descriptions of all weapons and armor listed in his library, and a roll of honor which mentions all important people on Faiumoni.<p>
Ados City has bakers who make pies, to sustain heroes in battle. These will be needed, as an experiment of Haizen's has gone wrong and dragons seem much more cunning than they've ever been! At the deathmatch arena in Ados, there is no place to hide .... ]]>

    <title>Server down for one week</title>
    <date>Wed, 24 May 2006 12:44:17</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[I get marrried in two days so I will turn off my computer, so from May, 24 to May, 29 the server will be down, and it may go down again until June, 12.<br>
We do need someone that can host the server 24/7 during summer because it is prone that I won't be able to handle it.<p>
All it is needed for server hosting is: 
<br><b>-</b> Java 1.5
<br><b>-</b> Stendhal
<br><b>-</b> Apache and PHP
<br><b>-</b> MySQL
<br><b>-</b> Optionally sshd to allow developers remote update of the server.
<p>
Bandwidth usage move around 1GB/day on release days to 150MB/day on common days.
Anyone willing to help please email me to arianne_rpg _at_ users _dot_ sourceforge _dot_ net]]>

    <title>Stendhal 0.48: Buddies</title>
    <date>Tue, 18 April 2006 14:13:00</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[This release should have happened two weeks above, but Sourceforge CVS failure and holidays took it out of schedule. We have added a buddy system so you can keep in touch with your friends, blood pools as a result of fights, player age :), new items and a new area near Ados called the swamp.<br>
We also removed some offending GFX, hide admin commands, fixed sheeps and simplified Xin Blanca items list.<p>
Next version is prone to take a few weeks of time because I really want to work now on GUI as most issues now are fixed and working.

Another feature that has been requested and has been added is a storage to safely place items: you can have a look to it at bank.<p>

Finally we have added several new areas that you will love: Orril castle and Semos mines, and inside Semos city you have now a Bank and a Storage.

      <![CDATA[Welcome to the biggest better ever release of Arianne.<p>
This release of stendhal features the biggest map we have ever had on the seven years of development. It has around 70 zones, many of them still to be populated. We also added around 50 new monsters so the monsters now range from level 0 to level 100.<p>
We added ranged combat with bow and arrows, and monsters can also use it.<br>
Stendhal now has a Quest and Scripts system <i>(done in java)</i> to create interesting Quests and make important game effects using the scripts. Be sure to give a try to Tad and Ceryl about their quests. We need your help to code more and more quests, so if you write Java contact <a href="mailto:arianne-devel@lists.sf.net">us</a>.<p>
Also I fixed a nasty bug on GUI that messed up the inventory. Now it won't happen again. Thanks for waiting.<p>
Unfortunatelly this release isn't named 0.50 because we still miss some important things:<br>
- More quests and NPCs.<br>
- Better AI System.<br>
- Improved A* to handle in a fasted way the path finding.<br>
- Magic system.<br>
- Skills system.<br>
- Improved GUI.<p>

Have a try to Stendhal! If you like it you will really love helping us to create content for it: maps, items, monsters, quests, ...]]>

      <![CDATA[Thanks to all of you for the bugs reports.<br>
        This release is the add some exciting features as different food pieces that heals at different rates, add potions to heal yourself fast on deep dungeons, venom creatures and poisons, add a new sound system. But this release is very important because of what it fixs: we have fixed the Timeout synchronization request that was due to ISP UDP packet size limits, we have also improved anticheaters features and dead is now something to take more serious.<p>
        The bad news is that we don't feature new zones on this release. We need help with map making to make more areas and improve existing ones, also if you have reached level 15 or above your gameplay experience won't be as good because almost nothing will give xp now. Please if it is the case, help up to create new creatures and new exciting areas. Join #arianne at irc.freenode.net to talk about this.<p>
        Have fun with this release and report bugs you may find. There is still a known bug at players inventory, so if you drag an item and drop on the same position the inventory will be incorrect and you won't be able to use it unless you change the zone or drop all the items on the floor and equip it again.]]>

      <![CDATA[Due to the huge amount ( thanks everybody! ) of bug reports recieved, we have decided to publish this bug fixed version.<p>
         Next release is going to delay for at least two weeks because we are in process of changing several things on Stendhal.<br>

      <![CDATA[As you can read on our previous news item, we have added money to game, so now in addition of gaining XP by killing monsterm you can inspect them to obtain too money. You can by now spend your money on the tavern weapon's seller.<p>
         This release is pretty stable, but many of the features are hacked, so we are going to enter in a refactoring to increase code quality that will surely delay a new release for at least 2-3 weeks. But in case you find any problem or a bug please <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=1111&atid=101111">tell us</a>.<p>
         We have decide to skip the addition of the new zones and the addition of chests ( but on the city ) because we need this version to be released as soon as possible, so we can start the refactoring today. So in order to speed up the development we would need help completing the maps and adding items and chests.<p>
         Please help us create content, items, monsters, maps and quest for Stendhal. Have a tour around our <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalRefactoring">new items, creatures and actions guide</a>.<p>
         This release of stendhal is also (again) together with a release of Marauroa: 1.11, that adds capacity limit to slots and fix a bug at slot assignID procedure.]]>

      <![CDATA[We have been idling for a few months, but in a few weeks we are doing again great improvements on the game and the gameplay. Matthias added a minimap so you can now orientate yourself on our
        dungeons and not get lost again. Also I completed the inventory stuff, so now you can use chests and move items between slots, chests and floor freely.<p>
        But the star feature of this upcoming release is the addition of corpses that contains items like shields, swords, armors and money. Yes! you read it correctly! Money. At last we have money in game to 
        buy new stuff, to buy sheep or simply to show off :P.<p>
        We plan to add ( at last too ) several new zones:
        <br>- Valley
        <br>- City road
        <br>- Rat dungeon
        <br>- Deeper dungeon
        <br>- Orc palace
        <br>- Orc jail
        <p>This new release should happen in 4-5 days as we have to polish several details in order to make simpler the usage of the new changes.]]>

    <content>
      <![CDATA[Holidays are over as summer is right now. During this two months, Stendhal and Marauroa has shown little progress, although a really nice effort has been done to port our logging system to log4j and to create an API in order to reuse Stendhal code base for other games.<br>
        The first task is complete and the results are simply awesome. Moving to log4j should have been done a great time before.<br>
        Unfortunately our second task; create an API for Stendhal is not so advanced, anyway we are sure and proud that soon we will show some very interesting results.<p>
        Meanwhile I am considering to release a 0.35 version that will add a basic inventory support and fix the ton of bugs most of you have pointed: mainly our lag problem. This release should happen along the next week if everything keeps working as it is now.]]>

    <title>Stendhal 0.31 release: bug fixes</title>
    <date>Fri, 08 Jul 2005 12:30:16</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[This release is a bug fixes over 0.30. We have fixed a bug at statistics system, speed up combat, ease creature killing, no more drop item bug, move item in inventory, 
fixed bug at Weapon seller, fix render order, added Giant rat, added three new areas: valley and rat dungeon (two levels), fixed a problem with long sentences, 
changed sprites to PNG, added Bag slot (1 item only) and modifiable server name at login text area.<br>
Unfortunately some of these changes are server related and we are right now unable to reset stendhal server, so we will need to wait up to Jul, 20 for the real update.<br>
Meanwhile we will keep developing new areas and the inventory system.<br>
As before please report problems or suggestions.<p>
IMHO I find the actual combat system too easy to kill monsters, so perhaps I do a rebalance again. Combat system is going to be replaced by a skill based system.<p>

      To get new items you need to buy them from Xin Blanca at the tavern.<p>This release unfortunately doesn't adds inventory support because we need a GUI framework to do it. I am actually working on it and hope to have it designed in one week so we can write a specification and start coding it.<p>
      This release also features a new RP system where weapons have effect in combat, so don't forget to wear them.<br> We will really love to read from any problem you may have with the game or any suggestion you may have.<p>

A complete game manual exists at <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalManual">http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalManual</a>.<p/>
<i>PS:</i> Don't forget to dress yourself. <br/>We are talking about replacing RP system with D20. We would love to listen to your opinion at Forums.]]>

      <![CDATA[This release is a very important milestone in the development of Arianne goals: creating a flexible open source multiplayer games middleware.<p/>
We have managed to build a system that is able to run several types of games: turn based and adventures games with a awesome performance. Send state of the game to players with a minimum bandwidth usage, storing players on database with a easy to query SQL tables.
The actual system is able to manage thousands of zones and so create an almost limitless world.<p/>
Now ariannexp will be ported to this 1.00 technology and soon Gladiators and mapacman will be ported and online again.<p/>
All the documentation is updated to this new branch, and we are in process of completing our 2nd book: <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/HowToWriteAdventureGamesUsingArianne">How to write adventure games using Arianne</a>.<p/>
This milestone completes inmediate Marauroa goals, so now we will now center all our efforts on clients: stendhal, mapacman and gladiators. By developing more these new needs will appear that will be done on next releases. Let's know what you need of Marauroa!.]]>

        Out next steps are:
        <br><b>-</b> Add wolf entity
        <br><b>-</b> Make combat real
        <br><b>-</b> Add currency to game
        <br><b>-</b> Add new Sheep GFX

         There are three open tasks that are of vital importance for Stendhal:

         <br><b>-</b> Define the entities RP values and the RP general guidelines, like how to attack, how fast, how fast to move, how is allowed to attack to, etc...</a>
         <br><b>-</b> Complete the manual about how to use Tiled to create maps for stendhal and add screenshots to it.</a>

         This release also features a new map editor using <a href="http://tiled.rpgdx.net/index.html">Tiled</a> with a write only plugin to create Stendhal maps, on CVS you can access our actual maps and the tileset used to create them... help is appreciated to build bigger and better maps :) We also added a GUI to Stendhal that makes simpler to login to server, and there is a Java Webstart feature.<p/>
	 We are working 110% on creating new GFX: samoa is creating a sheep and a wolf ( you can see it at Forums ).<br>
         Next steps are towards completing the RP system, and increasing the NPC interaction, and also fixing a strange bug that make game to work only sometimes ( most of them ).
         On the meanwhile you would like to help us close some <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalOpenTasks">tasks</a> related to Stendhal or review with us the <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalDesign">design document</a>.<p/>

    <date>Fri, 14 Jan 2005 14:27:16</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[Again, a few months without news of the development. Again, sorry. Development keeps moving and marauroa advances at a slow but constant speed. <br/>Waldemar ported all the code to Java 5.0 and I finally completed the change to multizone code. We both have changed the package structure of marauroa so that now it is clearer how to port it to J2ME or another language, as the server, client and commons parts are now independient packages.<p/>On the client side, I will begin to write a new Java2D client for our new game, Stendhal, so I will not update ariannexp for a while.<br/> I will try also to post more news if I have spare time.]]>

doesn't handle timeouts, when you feel something is not working
press ESC and you will be returned to the previous screen.<p/>
This released still miss the Create account from game feature
that may be added on the next release of marauroa: no promises.]]>

      <![CDATA[mapacman, our multiplayer online pacman clone, reaches its 0.90 version.
      <br/>This is the last release of mapacman because as you know our goal is to 
      create a real online multiplayer RPG and not a pacman game :)<p/>
      Now I will start working again on gladiators to make it a real game much like a
      simple Zelda clone. About if it is 2D or 3D is still to be decided, but it is prone
      that i finally goes after 2D because it is simpler to implement.<p/>
      This release features also a new ariannexp version that adds out of sync logic 
      support at the pyarianne side.]]>

		There are several things moving on arianne right now:<br>
		pyarianne is a python wrapper module for arianne clients, so you can now develop

		We have setup a wiki to write several docs, if you think you can help us, please 
		do it. <a href="/wiki">Wiki link</a><p/>
		Marauroa is moving also in a secure strong way, we are improving the speed of the 
		core game and fixing several things to make it run using as less CPU as possible, 
		so we can increase the player limit actually works correctly with around 64 players.<p/>
		On the coming weekend we perhaps do release something. Keep reading.

		<li>Added Python RP rules system, allowing to create a simple endless system</li>

    <content>
      <![CDATA[
	 	 On my way of "release often, release big" I have released a new version of 
	 	 Marauroa that adds the infamous delta-delta algorithm that allows to send only 
	 	 the differences of the objects that have changed, improving so the bandwidth usage.
	 	I also have released a working <i>( I tried them )</i> version of Gladiators 
	 	that is self contained, although you may need to install over 0.07 to get more 
	 	models and a new version of ariannexp that is the text test client that should 
	 	compile and run perfectly on linux too.<p/>
	 	Why in the hell there are no progress on gameplay? Nice question, I work alone
	 	( or better: I am working alone ) so I can't develop all by myself. 
	 	<i>root777</i> is doing a nice job at the Java side, but the client is only handled
	 	by me and I can't spend more time ( of what I spend now ) on it. Also our RP game
	 	designer is MIA <i>(miss in accion)</i>, but anyway the progress should come soon.<br>
	 	I do really need help with someone that could take care of a SDL-based graphical
	 	client. I have to keep developing the server side of the game and I am not going 
	 	to be able to keep in sync the client.<p/>
	 	Just step on the IRC channel or arianne-devel mailing and I will give you more info.

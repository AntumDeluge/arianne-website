      <![CDATA[Again,  on our weekly releases approach we present Stendhal 0.46. This version mostly fixs bugs and add a new interesting quest. We have fixed the sheep bug that made sheep to be transparent. All animations are now fixed, so if you see a strange area please report it as a bug.<p>
I have also rebalanced again creatures, please complain if you find them to hard. For top level players we have added Dragons and liches so they can party and enjoy :).<p>
There are some new items to fight against these formidable enemies: plate armors, golden armors, hammers, scythe, fire sword, ...<p>
Also per request Quests has been made simpler, so saying hi once you have started the quest trigger it.<p>
Finally we have added several new areas that you will love: Orril castle and Semos mines, and inside Semos city you have now a Bank and a Storage.
<p>
We still need your help to add content to world as items, creatures, quests, maps, bugs, suggestions or simply as a hardcore player. Please write <a href="mailto:arianne-general@lists.sf.net">us</a> if you are interested in helping.

      <![CDATA[Welcome to the biggest better ever release of Arianne.<p>
This release of stendhal features the biggest map we have ever had on the seven years of development. It has around 70 zones, many of them still to be populated. We also added around 50 new monsters so the monsters now range from level 0 to level 100.<p>
We added ranged combat with bow and arrows, and monsters can also use it.<br>
Stendhal now has a Quest and Scripts system <i>(done in java)</i> to create interesting Quests and make important game effects using the scripts. Be sure to give a try to Tad and Ceryl about their quests. We need your help to code more and more quests, so if you write Java contact <a href="mailto:arianne-devel@lists.sf.net">us</a>.<p>
Also I fixed a nasty bug on GUI that messed up the inventory. Now it won't happen again. Thanks for waiting.<p>
Unfortunatelly this release isn't named 0.50 because we still miss some important things:<br>
- More quests and NPCs.<br>
- Better AI System.<br>
- Improved A* to handle in a fasted way the path finding.<br>
- Magic system.<br>
- Skills system.<br>
- Improved GUI.<p>

Have a try to Stendhal! If you like it you will really love helping us to create content for it: maps, items, monsters, quests, ...]]>

      <![CDATA[Thanks to all of you for the bugs reports.<br>
        This release is the add some exciting features as different food pieces that heals at different rates, add potions to heal yourself fast on deep dungeons, venom creatures and poisons, add a new sound system. But this release is very important because of what it fixs: we have fixed the Timeout synchronization request that was due to ISP UDP packet size limits, we have also improved anticheaters features and dead is now something to take more serious.<p>
        The bad news is that we don't feature new zones on this release. We need help with map making to make more areas and improve existing ones, also if you have reached level 15 or above your gameplay experience won't be as good because almost nothing will give xp now. Please if it is the case, help up to create new creatures and new exciting areas. Join #arianne at irc.freenode.net to talk about this.<p>
        Have fun with this release and report bugs you may find. There is still a known bug at players inventory, so if you drag an item and drop on the same position the inventory will be incorrect and you won't be able to use it unless you change the zone or drop all the items on the floor and equip it again.]]>

      <![CDATA[Due to the huge amount ( thanks everybody! ) of bug reports recieved, we have decided to publish this bug fixed version.<p>
         Next release is going to delay for at least two weeks because we are in process of changing several things on Stendhal.<br>

      <![CDATA[As you can read on our previous news item, we have added money to game, so now in addition of gaining XP by killing monsterm you can inspect them to obtain too money. You can by now spend your money on the tavern weapon's seller.<p>
         This release is pretty stable, but many of the features are hacked, so we are going to enter in a refactoring to increase code quality that will surely delay a new release for at least 2-3 weeks. But in case you find any problem or a bug please <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=1111&atid=101111">tell us</a>.<p>
         We have decide to skip the addition of the new zones and the addition of chests ( but on the city ) because we need this version to be released as soon as possible, so we can start the refactoring today. So in order to speed up the development we would need help completing the maps and adding items and chests.<p>         Please help us create content, items, monsters, maps and quest for Stendhal. Have a tour around our <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalRefactoring">new items, creatures and actions guide</a>.<p>
         This release of stendhal is also (again) together with a release of Marauroa: 1.11, that adds capacity limit to slots and fix a bug at slot assignID procedure.]]>

      <![CDATA[We have been idling for a few months, but in a few weeks we are doing again great improvements on the game and the gameplay. Matthias added a minimap so you can now orientate yourself on our
        dungeons and not get lost again. Also I completed the inventory stuff, so now you can use chests and move items between slots, chests and floor freely.<p>
        But the star feature of this upcoming release is the addition of corpses that contains items like shields, swords, armors and money. Yes! you read it correctly! Money. At last we have money in game to 
        buy new stuff, to buy sheep or simply to show off :P.<p>
        We plan to add ( at last too ) several new zones:
        <br>- Valley
        <br>- City road
        <br>- Rat dungeon
        <br>- Deeper dungeon
        <br>- Orc palace
        <br>- Orc jail
        <p>This new release should happen in 4-5 days as we have to polish several details in order to make simpler the usage of the new changes.]]>

      <![CDATA[Holidays are over as summer is right now. During this two months, Stendhal and Marauroa has shown little progress, although a really nice effort has been done to port our logging system to log4j and to create an API in order to reuse Stendhal code base for other games.<br>
        The first task is complete and the results are simply awesome. Moving to log4j should have been done a great time before.<br>
        Unfortunately our second task; create an API for Stendhal is not so advanced, anyway we are sure and proud that soon we will show some very interesting results.<p>
        Meanwhile I am considering to release a 0.35 version that will add a basic inventory support and fix the ton of bugs most of you have pointed: mainly our lag problem. This release should happen along the next week if everything keeps working as it is now.]]>

    <title>Stendhal 0.31 release: bug fixes</title>
    <date>Fri, 08 Jul 2005 12:30:16</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[This release is a bug fixes over 0.30. We have fixed a bug at statistics system, speed up combat, ease creature killing, no more drop item bug, move item in inventory, 
fixed bug at Weapon seller, fix render order, added Giant rat, added three new areas: valley and rat dungeon (two levels), fixed a problem with long sentences, 
changed sprites to PNG, added Bag slot (1 item only) and modifiable server name at login text area.<br>
Unfortunately some of these changes are server related and we are right now unable to reset stendhal server, so we will need to wait up to Jul, 20 for the real update.<br>
Meanwhile we will keep developing new areas and the inventory system.<br>
As before please report problems or suggestions.<p>
IMHO I find the actual combat system too easy to kill monsters, so perhaps I do a rebalance again. Combat system is going to be replaced by a skill based system.<p>

      <![CDATA[Muahahaha! ok!, 0.30 is here! I know you have been waiting it. We have added finally the long awaited items system and you can wear them, by now only a club, a sword, a shield and a leather armor. We will add more on next releases.<br>
      To get new items you need to buy them from Xin Blanca at the tavern.<p>This release unfortunately doesn't adds inventory support because we need a GUI framework to do it. I am actually working on it and hope to have it designed in one week so we can write a specification and start coding it.<p>
      This release also features a new RP system where weapons have effect in combat, so don't forget to wear them.<br> We will really love to read from any problem you may have with the game or any suggestion you may have.<p>

      <![CDATA[This release is a very important milestone in the development of Arianne goals: creating a flexible open source multiplayer games middleware.<p/>
We have managed to build a system that is able to run several types of games: turn based and adventures games with a awesome performance. Send state of the game to players with a minimum bandwidth usage, storing players on database with a easy to query SQL tables.
The actual system is able to manage thousands of zones and so create an almost limitless world.<p/>
Now ariannexp will be ported to this 1.00 technology and soon Gladiators and mapacman will be ported and online again.<p/>
All the documentation is updated to this new branch, and we are in process of completing our 2nd book: <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/HowToWriteAdventureGamesUsingArianne">How to write adventure games using Arianne</a>.<p/>
This milestone completes inmediate Marauroa goals, so now we will now center all our efforts on clients: stendhal, mapacman and gladiators. By developing more these new needs will appear that will be done on next releases. Let's know what you need of Marauroa!.]]>

      <![CDATA[A new week, almost a new release :)<br>I have added combat to Stendhal and HP bars, and a basic in game GUI.<br>Release should happen soon, exactly at the same moment I assign <i>coherent</i> RP values to entities.<p/>
         Also the CVS code has been cleaned and refactored, so Client is now clearer than ever. If you plan to create a game using Arianne, Stendhal would be a great base for your client. :)<p/>
         On the near future <i>(1 month or so)</i> I will stabilize Stendhal development and start again all the documentation process that means:
        <br><b>-</b> Document all the code.
        <br><b>-</b> Fix, update and improve Wiki Documents.
        <br><b>-</b> Complete <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalDesign">Stendhal Design</a> document

        Out next steps are:
        <br><b>-</b> Add wolf entity
        <br><b>-</b> Make combat real
        <br><b>-</b> Add currency to game
        <br><b>-</b> Add new Sheep GFX

         I am actually in need of someone with RP gaming experience that wants to help me to create a simple game system based on S6S and give correct values to entities values.<p/>
         There are three open tasks that are of vital importance for Stendhal:
         <br><b>-</b> Create a game manual at <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalManual">http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalManual</a>
         <br><b>-</b> Define the entities RP values and the RP general guidelines, like how to attack, how fast, how fast to move, how is allowed to attack to, etc...</a>
         <br><b>-</b> Complete the manual about how to use Tiled to create maps for stendhal and add screenshots to it.</a>

      <![CDATA[Our second release of Stendhal, and again it is not intended to be playable (<b>NO PLAYABLE</b>). You can walk, chat, collide, move from one zone to another, talk to NPC, attack other players and our dummy, but it lacks of the quality to consider it playable.<p/>
         This release also features a new map editor using <a href="http://tiled.rpgdx.net/index.html">Tiled</a> with a write only plugin to create Stendhal maps, on CVS you can access our actual maps and the tileset used to create them... help is appreciated to build bigger and better maps :) We also added a GUI to Stendhal that makes simpler to login to server, and there is a Java Webstart feature.<p/>
	 We are working 110% on creating new GFX: samoa is creating a sheep and a wolf ( you can see it at Forums ).<br>
         Next steps are towards completing the RP system, and increasing the NPC interaction, and also fixing a strange bug that make game to work only sometimes ( most of them ).
         On the meanwhile you would like to help us close some <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalOpenTasks">tasks</a> related to Stendhal or review with us the <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalDesign">design document</a>.<p/>
         There is still no public server for Stendhal...

      <![CDATA[After a full weekend of work, I have added a GUI to Stendhal. It is a bit basic but useful enough to make the game playable.<p/>
         Next step is about adding attack and heal actions and make multizone works in a more intuitive way.<br>The point is to add <i>*slowly*</i> new features to build a complete game as soon as possible. You can read the complete plan at our Wiki in <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalObjectives">StendhalObjectives</a><br>
         BTW I keep begging for help to close these <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/StendhalOpenTasks">tasks</a> :)<p/>
         The most important task to complete now it 100% related to GFX; we do need new GFX as explained in the Stendhal tasks.

      <![CDATA[As I said, development is showing some interesting results in a short period of time. The actual <i>client</i> allows the player to move and collide with objects that exists on world. Problem is that the client is a development work thing, and need to be refactored in order to be released, but I think that around 2 weeks could be something available.<p/>AS preview, just a video: <a href="http://stendhal.game-server.cc/Stendhal_0.00_Video.avi">Stendhal 0.00 video</a> (24") 266KB]]>

    <title>Big change coming in Marauroa</title>
    <date>Fri, 14 Jan 2005 14:27:16</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[Again, a few months without news of the development. Again, sorry. Development keeps moving and marauroa advances at a slow but constant speed. <br/>Waldemar ported all the code to Java 5.0 and I finally completed the change to multizone code. We both have changed the package structure of marauroa so that now it is clearer how to port it to J2ME or another language, as the server, client and commons parts are now independient packages.<p/>On the client side, I will begin to write a new Java2D client for our new game, Stendhal, so I will not update ariannexp for a while.<br/> I will try also to post more news if I have spare time.]]>

      simple Zelda clone. About if it is 2D or 3D is still to be decided, but it is prone
      that i finally goes after 2D because it is simpler to implement.<p/>

        It has been a lot of work, but finally everything is up and running:<ul>
		<li><i>Marauroa 0.36</i> Real pacman support, improved the way password are 
		  stored in database, speeded up marauroa to make clients see their actions 
		  result sooner and added command line support for nullClient</li>
		<li><i>ariannexp 0.10.1 and pyarianne 0.10.1</i> Added compressed RPMap 
		  message support, improved autoconf and automake files and released a 
		  compiled version of pyarianne so you can develop your own games easily.</li>
		<li><i>Gladiators 0.08.5.3</i> Enjoy this one because it is the last version

		  python version of it that will work in a different way.</li>
		<li><i>mapacman 0.01</i> The first mapacman release. Please give it a try 
		  but don't eat the ghost :-)</li></ul>
		Also I have added a Tutorial about how to create games using Arianne, please

      <![CDATA[
		There are several things moving on arianne right now:<br>
		pyarianne is a python wrapper module for arianne clients, so you can now develop 
		arianne clients using Python and surely pygame :)<p/>
		We have setup a wiki to write several docs, if you think you can help us, please 
		do it. <a href="/wiki">Wiki link</a><p/>
		Marauroa is moving also in a secure strong way, we are improving the speed of the 
		core game and fixing several things to make it run using as less CPU as possible, 
		so we can increase the player limit actually works correctly with around 64 players.<p/>
		On the coming weekend we perhaps do release something. Keep reading.

		<li>Added Python RP rules system, allowing to create a simple endless system</li>
		<li>Added mapacman game, our next milestone development</li>

		On the client side, I have been able to remove the nasty memory leak, and now client leaks 
		nothing on the main loop<p/>

    <title>Marauroa 0.31, Gladiators 0.08.2 and ariannexp 0.08.2 released</title>
    <date>Wed, 14 Apr 2004 12:23:02 GMT</date>
    <content>
      <![CDATA[
	 	 On my way of "release often, release big" I have released a new version of 
	 	 Marauroa that adds the infamous delta-delta algorithm that allows to send only 
	 	 the differences of the objects that have changed, improving so the bandwidth usage.
	 	I also have released a working <i>( I tried them )</i> version of Gladiators 
	 	that is self contained, although you may need to install over 0.07 to get more 
	 	models and a new version of ariannexp that is the text test client that should 
	 	compile and run perfectly on linux too.<p/>
	 	Why in the hell there are no progress on gameplay? Nice question, I work alone
	 	( or better: I am working alone ) so I can't develop all by myself. 
	 	<i>root777</i> is doing a nice job at the Java side, but the client is only handled
	 	by me and I can't spend more time ( of what I spend now ) on it. Also our RP game
	 	designer is MIA <i>(miss in accion)</i>, but anyway the progress should come soon.<br>
	 	I do really need help with someone that could take care of a SDL-based graphical
	 	client. I have to keep developing the server side of the game and I am not going 
	 	to be able to keep in sync the client.<p/>
	 	Just step on the IRC channel or arianne-devel mailing and I will give you more info.

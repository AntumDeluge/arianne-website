  <description><![CDATA[
<p>Stendhal has a huge and rich world. You can explore cities, forest, mountains, mines, plains, caves and dungeons.</p>
<p>
You could meet over 300 NPCs, many will give you tasks and quests for valuable experience, shiny gold, but mainly a warm fuzzy feeling. You may be asked to help protect land or people from danger, feed the hungry, heal the sick, make someone happy, solve a puzzle, play a game or simply lend a hand. You can keep track of your progress using a Travel Log.</p>
<p>
Your character will develop and grow and with each new level up become stronger and better. With the money you acquire you can buy new items and improve your armour and weapons, trade with friends, or look for what other players are giving away in the 'community chest'.</p>
<p>
If you just want to fight that helps too - the cities could get overrun by monsters without you!</p>
<blockquote>
Start playing, get hooked... and if you like, get the source code, and add your own ideas!</blockquote>
<p>So what are you waiting for? A whole new world awaits...</p>
